What is a HandlerAdapter?

The HandlerAdapter is basically an interface which facilitates the handling of HTTP requests in a very flexible manner in Spring MVC.
It’s used in conjunction with the HandlerMapping, which maps a method to a specific URL.
The DispatcherServlet then uses a HandlerAdapter to invoke this method. The servlet doesn’t invoke the method directly – it basically serves as a bridge between itself and the handler objects, leading to a loosely coupling design.
